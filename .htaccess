#  READ THIS COMPLETELY IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THIS FILE

#

# The line just below this section: 'Options +FollowSymLinks' may cause problems

# with some server configurations.  It is required for use of mod_rewrite, but may already

# be set by your server administrator in a way that dissallows changing it in

# your .htaccess file.  If using it causes your server to error out, comment it out (add # to 

# beginning of line), reload your site in your browser and test your sef url's.  If they work,

# it has been set by your server administrator and you do not need it set here. 

#

# Only use one of the two SEF sections that follow.  Lines that can be uncommented

# (and thus used) have only one #.  Lines with two #'s should not be uncommented

# In the section that you don't use, all lines should start with #

#####  SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH COMPONENT URL's that don't work #####

# SPECIAL NOTE FOR SMF USERS WHEN SMF IS INTEGRATED AND BRIDGED

# OR ANY SITUATION WHERE A COMPONENT's URL's AREN't WORKING

#

# In both the 'Standard SEF', and '3rd Party or Core SEF' sections the line:

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(/component/option,com) [NC,OR] ##optional - see notes##

# May need to be uncommented.  If you are running your Joomla from

# a subdirectory the name of the subdirectory will need to be inserted into this

# line.  For example, if your Joomla is in a subdirectory called '/test/',

# change this:

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(/component/option,com) [NC,OR] ##optional - see notes##

# to this:

# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(/test/component/option,com) [NC,OR] ##optional - see notes##
