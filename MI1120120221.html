"Discover The Secret That Transformed Your Child's Life Positively By Enabling His/Her Brain To Start Functioning Optimally That Will Last Them A Life Time. . .. . .And How You As A Parent Can Benefit Instantaneously From Their Positive Development!"<br>
<br>
 Genius Mind Academy uses a unique sound technology to unlock your child's hidden potential.<br>
<br>
 Genius Mind Academy offers a revolutionary technique in developing your child's mind that will impact them positively for the rest of their life.<br>
<br>
 The workshop is delivered in a fun-filled way! 2 days are what it takes for most children to achieve the results, and these positive changes are permanent for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>
 Amongst other things, one of the most amazing phenomena of an activated child is the ability to tell colors, read and/or write even with eyes blindfolded.<br>
<br>
Of course, as a parent, the ability to read blindfolded is not what you are after. Mid brain is the 'bridge' between the left and right brain. An active mid brain therefore allows a more balanced use of the whole brain, and therefore mid brain activated children typically show tremendous improvements in one or more of the following areas: Memory, Concentration, Creativity, Motor Control, Health and Characters.<br>
<br>
To date, over 100,000 children are activated worldwide and &gt;1700 children are activated in singapore since July 2010..<br>
<br>
*Applicable to Child Age 6 - 15 years old<br>

                    <big><big><b>Learn film acting from me and get the chance to star as the lead in a professionally-directed and -edited short film which you can show to future casting directors. Learn film directing and you make a professional short film which you can submit to film festivals for screening and competitions.</b></big></big><br>
<br>
<font color="purple">I am a film director and actor. I was trained in directing and acting at the New York Film Academy at Universal Studios, Hollywood, and at the London International Film School, London. I have 11 years of experience in directing and acting, including directing in Hollywood and acting on MediaCorp TV's Channel 5. </font><br>
<br>
<font color="purple">Currently I am teaching film directing and acting to beginners and those with little experience.</font> <br>
<br>
<font color="green">The Acting Course: <br>
<br>
My course is the only short acting course in Singapore in which students will get the chance to act in the leading role in a professionally-directed and -edited short film. This is because I am both an actor and a director. In other short acting courses in Singapore, the teachers are just trained and experienced actors. They are not filmmakers. <br>
<br>
Please go to my website below regarding the acting subjects taught. One of the subjects is "How To Impress A Casting Director".  I know well as I have conducted auditions myself as a casting director. I teach my students not just how to be natural but develop their own style too to stand out from the crowd -- like Bruce Lee or Clint Eastwood.<br>
<br>
Many of my students have secured roles in shows on MediaCorp TV. An example: one of my current students has acted in MediaCorp's Suria and Vasantham channels and a commercial after just 3 sessions of workshop with me. You can check him out at Vasantham's "Marupakkam", episode 15, at www.xinmsn.com (click Catch Up TV). He's the Chinese cop towards the end of the show.<br>
<br>
At the end of the course, you will be given a certificate and a DVD of your short film and performances which you can show to future casting directors.<br>
<br>
Let me guide you effectively on the road to FAME and FORTUNE. If you have the passion and are hardworking, I can guarantee you you will get roles on MediaCorp TV shows, in TV and cinema commercials, in corporate videos, etc. And I know where to look for their audition ads which I will share with you. It doesn't matter if you don't have the matinee idol looks to get the lead roles. If everybody wanted to play leads and not characters, there wouldn't be any TV dramas or movies made. As you know, dramas or sitcoms must reflect the real world: the characters are mainly average- or plain-looking, old or young, fat or thin, tall or short. So the demand for the ordinary-looking people is great. Some have played leads on MediaCorp TV, eg, Mark Lee, Patricia Mok, Selena Tan and Hosanna Leong. In Hollywood, it's Woody Allen, Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, etc.<br>
<br>
Once you have attained fame on TV through an important role in a series , you can let advertisers use your name and photo for a fee in their ads without really doing anything -- easy money.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="red">The Directing Course:<br>
<br>
I will teach you everything you need to know about directing. That is, engaging storytelling with the camera, lights, setting or location, props, continuity, casting the right people, ensuring right acting from cast, special effects, music.<br>
<br>
Towards the end of the workshop, you will make a short film like in a real situation. You are the producer and director. You choose your genre or what type of film you want to make -- drama, comedy, thriller, horror, musical, etc. You  solicit for financial sponsorship(optional), create the story, write the screenplay, find your cast and crew, find your location, etc. And you decide how long your movie will be. I will just be an advisor. When the film is made, you can submit it to the Singapore Film Festival or film festivals abroad, hoping to win an award which will help you to get financing and partnership for the feature you have always dreamt of making. This opportunity to direct a short film like in a real situation is not available with other short filmmaking courses in Singapore.<br>
<br>
At the end of the course, you will receive a certificate and your professionally-edited short film.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="blue">Fee:<br>
<br>
Fee: $280 for 5 sessions, each 2 hrs, on Saturdays or Sundays. However, at the end of the 5 sessions, if you feel you need more training, I will give a session to you free. After that,  it's $50 a session.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="black">Future Opportunity:<br>
<br>
I have planned to do an English, Elvis-type romantic-musical feature in the near future with an American-Singaporean cast for international film festivals. I hope to get a distributor for world-wide release from the publicity. My students will have a chance to be in my film or behind the camera if they are good.</font><br>

                    Hello,<br>
<br>
My name is Vicky. I was born in mainland China in a city near Beijing. I spent my first 20 years in China and then moved to Singapore 12 years ago. Singapore has a very good education system and I received my higher education here.My formative childhood years were spent in China, but my adult life has been shaped by Singapore. Chinese is my mother tongue. I really love this beautiful language, but for me it is much more than a language. Chinese is a rich art form. It contains over 5000 years of Chinese history, culture and etiquette.<br>
<br>
I am an able and experienced tutor. It is my passion to share my knowledge and motivate my students. When I see my friends and pupils improve their Chinese skills, it fills me with great satisfaction and joy. If you are interested in learning Chinese and exploring Chinese culture, then please contact me! You wont be sorry. You can master Chinese with a little help from me.<br>

                    Hello, I am a native Japanese tutor, been working as a Japanese teacher since 2001.<br>
<br>
My class is focused on speaking practice and so, it might be a bit stressful for students. <br>
But I can say, good stress will work for fast improvement.<br>
<br>
Tuition fee is $60 (60min) and I am not asking you to come my place. Negotiable.<br>
<br>
I am currently teaching adults and children<br>
<br>
Kindly contact 90709072 for more info, cheers!<!-- START CLTAGS -->

                    Hi there, <br>
<br>
I am looking for a new mandarin teacher as my current teacher has had to stop teaching indefinitely..<br>
<br>
I would like to do 1 and 1/2 hours a week, preferably on a tuesday evening, 7pm. <br>
<br>
I am looking for a teacher who can communicate well, and who uses some texts/structure to their classes. <br>
<br>
I am looking to pay around $40 per session. <br>
<br>
Please drop me a line. <br>
<br>
Kind regards<br>
<br>

<br>
I wish to learn to speak Korean.  So far, I know a few phrases but cannot really converse.  However, I am fluent in spoken and written English so I will be more than willing to teach English and be taught Korean in return.<br>
<br>
I am based in Sengkang at the moment but I may be able to meet where it is most convenient for both parties.  Thank you.<!-- START CLTAGS -->

                    Highly effective people who are not only happy, but also fulfilled are action minded. <br>
They are DOERS and not TALKERS -- they know that actions speak louder than words.<br>
<br>
The truth is..<br>
<br>
Procrastinating and being action minded are just different sides of the same MINDSET<br>
<br>
Being action minded is nothing but a pshychology ; it's only a mindset.<br>
<br>
Ironically, so is procrastination and indecision -- it's only a mindset and a way of thinking. <br>
<br>
It's not because of anything outside yourself and you hold the key to changing you. <br>

                    I NEED some HELP -- I am slightly disabled (on crutches) and had to quit my job to study fulltime in order to fulfil GCE A' requirements in 10 months.  So I don't have alot of money at the moment to pay for a regular commercial tutor. I'm just sending out this honest appeal for some kind-hearted person who can spare me just some time once a week to help me with these subjects -- Maths and Physics. I can help towards your transportation but I don't have so much more. I missed some of the foundational principles for these subjects as I was not brought up or educated in Singapore before. So the Singapore GCE 'A' is quite a challenge for me now. <br>
Thanks for considering -- please drop me a line if you can help!  <!-- START CLTAGS -->

                    Hi,<br>
<br>
I am looking for a bandoneon (tango accordion) instructor. I recently bought a bandoneon and am desperate to learn how to play it. I know that it would be almost impossible to locate a bandoneonist in Singapore, but I am willing to give it a shot nonetheless. Please contact me if you have any info. <!-- START CLTAGS -->

                    Bismillahirrahmaanirraheem<br>
<br>
I am always available to help any interested and willing person or persons who wish to become a Muslim and convert to the true deen (way) of Allah, and follow a correct and balanced way  of life inshallah.  <br>
<br>
Allah says in the Quran: La ikraha fiddeen (which translates to mean:  There is no compulsion in religion) i.e. no one can force you to become a Muslim but only if Allah guides.  Islam is a verb, and those who follow this way are called Muslims. <br>
<br>
The basic foundation of a Muslim's belief is the certain belief in ONE God (Allah), that there is no other diety worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (s.a.w) is his messenger.  We also pray the obligatory prayer in the same way Jesus and Abraham and the prophets before were told to pray, we pay a sum of our wealth every year to the poor, we fast in the month of Ramadan, and we make pilgrimage to Makkah which is also called Bakka in the Quran (3:96) and also in the Bible (Psalms 84:6).   <br>
<br>
So if you are interested in a pure way of life, I am here to help without any compensation or reward. My time for you is free and there is no fee or compensation.  Pls feel free to ask me if you wish to meet me wherever you feel comfortable.  <br>
<br>
Your brother in Islam<br>
